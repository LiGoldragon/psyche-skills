description: A protos parser or printer is designed or judged for how contexts take over and resume.
dependencies: [knowledge-protos]

Protos parsing always happens inside a context, and only the
current context gives shapes their meaning: it defines which
shapes can appear next and which shape completes it. A met shape
announces a type, and that type's context takes over completely
until its completing shape; then the parent context resumes
exactly where it left off. Reading and writing are one walk in
two directions — text lands in typed values, and typed values
project back into the same text.

## Sources

Provenance: wording Designer-drafted through the two-way
structural transcoding flesh-out
(design/ProtosEngine/twoWayStructuralTranscoding-2026-08-11.md);
approved as Intent by the psyche 2026-08-13T00:19+02:00 ("the
intent is good", Designer session a5587095). The ruling trail —
context-switching parse, the stack keeping the parent's position,
a child context taking the shapes' meaning — is in
psyche/Vision/protosIsTheSharedStyle.md.

*(2026-08-14 annotation, consistency audit: "two-way structural transcoding" in this provenance paragraph is dead vocabulary — code/encoded was dropped 2026-08-13 per encodedFormIsTheCode.md 2026-08-13; the two-way walk concept stands under the real/signal/textual forms frame. The Intent body itself is unaffected.)*
