## A proof of concept is tested in a sandbox first

A proof of concept is tested in a sandbox first. The sandbox is a
virtual machine running on a node that has that feature; which node is
found by querying Horizon. A proof of concept runs outside a sandbox
only when it cannot run in one, such as a browser login with the
living's credentials.
